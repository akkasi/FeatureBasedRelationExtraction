"Since CNK1 can bind RASSF1A or RASSF1C ( but not NORE1 )       and RASSF1A can interact with MST1 and 2     , it was proposed that RASSF1A may provide the mechanism linking the two proteins .",0
"Stimulation of the death receptors with TNFalpha ( tumour necrosis factor alpha ) or TNFalpha related apoptosis inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) resulted in recruitment of RASSF1A and modulator of apoptosis-1 ( MAP-1 ) proteins to the receptor complexes and promoted complex formation between RASSF1A and MAP-1 ; MAP-1 is normally inhibited by an intramolecular interaction , however , the binding of RASSF1A to MAP-1 relieved this inhibitory interaction , resulting in MAP-1 association with Bax      .",0

This Ras-GAP and p190 complex may function together to regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics .  Over-expression of the NH 2  terminus of Ras-GAP in RAT-2 cells induced abnormal actin SFs and decreased cell substratum adhesion and this correlated with increased in vitro Rho GAP activity compared with untransfected cells .,1

"Increase in cAMP upon stimulation of the latter receptor transiently inhibits PKB phosphorylation .

"GEFs facilitate the release of bound nucleotide from Ras to produce nucleotide-free Ras which preferentially binds GTP due to the higher cellular concentrations of GTP over GDP thereby leading to Ras activation .

"SMAD2 and IKKalpha bind concurrently to the Snail1 promoter between -631 and -506 bp , resulting in Snail1 's upregulation .  HMGA2 cooperates in this complex as well , as the binding of HMGA2 to the Snail1 promoter increases SMAD binding .",2
"RYBP interacts with MDM2 to decrease MDM2 mediated p53 ubiquitination while RNF2 promotes p53 degradation .  HIPK2 , tumor suppressor ( Ts ) protein phosphorylates MDM2 , promoting its proteasomal degradation while the Rb Ts forms a ternary complex with p53 and MDM2 .",0
"The second step is the binding of the cellularly abundant GTP to the wt Ras complexed with Cdc25 ; this binding expels the bound Cdc25 from wt Ras to produce GTP bound wt Ras .  Given that an oxidant inhibits the catalytic action of Cdc25 on wt Ras that is an enhancement of the wt Ras bound GDP , the oxidant evidently targets the ternary complex           .",0

"Although a previous report suggested that PI3KC2beta and Ras do not interact in vitro     , we sought to determine whether PI3KC2beta interacted with Ras in cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( BiFC )     ,     .  We observed significant interaction between PI3KC2beta and Ras on a perinuclear population vesicles .",0
"The interaction between Akt and GSK-3 has yet further repercussions , although Akt maintains its pro-developmental role in allowing glycogen synthesis         .

"As shown in         , sub-cellular localization of the K-Ras and Raf1 complexes which was mainly distributed in the cell membrane  varied from the K-Ras-C185S / Raf1 , which was mainly localized in the cytoplasm , and these distinct subcellular localizations were further confirmed in different imaging depth , indicating that the C-terminal CAAX site is the determinant for sub-cellular localization of K-Ras and Raf1 complexes , which is consistent with previous reports .  However , with respect to membrane localization , the Raf1 and K-Ras-C 185S complexes could move to the cell membrane .",0
"UHRF1 expression blocked K120 acetylation of p53 by Tip60 whereas its depletion significantly increased K120 acetylation and p53 dependent apoptosis .  UHRF1 binds directly to Tip60 through its SRA ( Set and RING associated ) and RING ( really interesting new gene ) domains , and in so doing markedly inhibits Tip60 and p53 complex formation .",0
"It is worthwhile to keep in mind that p300 can acetylate HDAC6 , causing a decrease in HDAC6 's deacetylating activity .  This action of p300 can also modulate HDAC6 nuclear import by blocking the HDAC6 and importin-alpha interaction .",0
"The activity of HMGB1 triggered cytokine production via TLR4 is sensitive to the redox state of HMGB1 as it binds to TLR4 in a structure specific manner .

"Our results suggest that Gal-3 levels modulate Ras activity in pancreatic cancer cells , since down regulation of Gal-3 decreases Ras activity while up regulation of Gal-3 increases Ras activity in pancreatic cancer cells .  Using antibody array based screens and immunoprecipitation assays , we found that Gal-3 can bind to Ras in pancreatic cancer cells and retain Ras in the plasma membrane where it activates its downstream signaling .",0
"Scaffolding proteins such as MEK partner ( MPI ) or kinase suppressor of Ras ( KSR ) enhance the MEK and ERK signaling pathway in response to different stimuli [  ,  -  ] .  The KSR and MEK complex is recruited to the membrane following dephosphorylation by phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) at the Ser392 residue leading to release 14-3-3 from KSR and then exposes the C1 domain , which is required for the membrane localization of KSR , as well as the FxFP MAPK binding site .",0
"The oncogenic kinase , casein kinase 2 ( CK2 ) , is able to phosphorylate PML on serine 565 and promote proteosome dependent degradation of PML .  Consequently , PML mutants that can not be phosphorylated by CK2 have more potent tumor suppressor properties , providing a strong link between regulation of PML by CK2 and tumorigenesis   .",0
"We therefore hypothesized that Gal-3 would bind with Ras and mediate Ras activity in PDAC cells characterized by the frequent occurrence of Ras mutations .

"The mTOR and Raptor complexes in response to TNFalpha and insulin , are involved with IKKalpha and IKKbeta .

"Upon starvation , cBcl-2 is phosphorylated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 ( JNK1 ) , which causes disruption of the cBcl-2 / Beclin and 1 complex .

"Moreover , in humans exposed to tobacco smoke , lycopene treatment inhibits lung metaplasia by upregulating IGFBP3 and by decreasing the phosphorylation of BAD , thereby promoting apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation .  This study suggested that IGFBP3 might inhibit both the PI3K/AKT/PKB and the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase signalling pathways in lung cancer cells , as PI3K mediates the phosphorylation of BAD on serine 136  and MAPK mediates the phosphorylation of BAD on serine 112  .",0
"p53KRKKK increased phosphorylation of HtrA2 and Omi in mitochondria and decreased the invasion of Ras transformed p53 -/ -  MEFs .  Altogether , these results suggest that cytoplasmic p53 restricts Ras induced cell invasion through increasing p38 MAPK induced HtrA2 and Omi activation in mitochondria .",0
"In theory , C84A mutation in the extreme C-terminal region of the BIR domain can disrupt the Zn 2+  coordination sphere and subsequently inhibit the interactions between survivin and Smac and DIA-BLO .  Therefore , T34A and C84A survivin mutant may induce cancer cell death through two distinct mechanisms : ( 1 ) by forming a heterodimer with the wild-type survivin , leading to the reduced interaction with caspase-9 ; and ( 2 ) by reducing the interaction between survivin and Smac and DIABLO , leading to an increased binding between Smac and DIABLO and XIAP , resulting in the activity inhibition of XIAP .",0
"This suggests that PAK scaffolding might direct the substrate specificity of Akt or limit its accessibility towards a subset of its substrates or both .  It remains unclear , however , how the PAK dependent PDK1 and Akt complex , which is formed at the cell membrane , affects nuclear Akt substrates .",0
"Whether SKP2 is a direct transcriptional target of MYCN remains to be determined .  However , as c-MYC and MYCN are known to share some common target genes , and c-MYC has recently been shown to directly bind to two high affinity E-Box motifs ( CATGCG and CACGCG ) mapping to -756 and -389 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site within the SKP2 promoter and drive transcription ( Bretones et al. ,     ) , it is therefore possible that MYCN may also directly regulate SKP2 expression           .",0
"While these proteins can bind cyclin or kinase ( depending on the family member ) , to inhibit the binding of the other and prevent cyclin and CDK complexing , there are many cases where these CKIs have been found bound to active cyclin D and CDK4 complexes .  In this sense , the cyclin D and CDK4 complex may have a role in sequestering CKI , preventing p27 and p21 from inhibiting the cyclin E and CDK2 complex   .",0
"In addition , binding of nucleotide-free Ras to PI3KC2beta inhibits its lipid kinase activity .  The PI3KC2beta and Ras complex may then translocate to distal sites such as early endosomes ( EE ) where ITSN1 then binds to PI3KC2beta leading to the release of nucleotide-free Ras and activation of the lipid kinase activity of PI3KC2beta .",0
"Although SOCS1 contains a Cul5 box , no interaction between SOCS1 and Cul5 has been detected , most likely because the Cul5 box is incompletely conserved ( Kamura et al. ,     ) .  Since SOCS1 polyubiquitinates JAK2 , Vav , IRS1 , and IRS2 ( De Sepulveda et al. ,     ; Kamizono et al. ,     ; Rui et al. ,     ) , it is possible that the interaction of SOCS1 with these substrates recruits other ubiquitin ligase ( s ) that actually mediate their polyubiquitination and degradation , or that SOCS1 binds to the Cul5-Rbx2 module too weakly to have been previously detected ( Kamura et al. ,     ) .",0
"In this study , inhibition of ERK2 with specific drugs or siRNA decreased the interaction between PML and Pin1 , leading to upregulation of PML and PML-NBs formation .

",   The first of these is the binding of Cdc25 to the GDP bound wt Ras to produce the ternary wt Ras-GDP-Cdc25 complex .  The formation of the ternary complex disrupts the binding interaction between wt Ras and GDP , resulting in release of the bound GDP to produce the wt Ras Cdc25 binary complex .  The second step is the binding of the cellularly abundant GTP to the wt Ras complexed with Cdc25 ; this binding expels the bound Cdc25 from wt Ras to produce GTP bound wt Ras .",1
"Additionally , the phosphorylation of FBW7 by ERK was abolished by calf intestinal phosphatase ( CIP ) treatment , indicating that ERK kinase modulates FBW7 in a phosphorylation dependent manner .  To prove that ERK kinase directly phosphorylates FBW7 , glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) - fused recombinant FBW7 proteins , both wild type and T205A mutant , were incubated with purified HA-ERK1 kinase in the presence of ATP and detected with the p-FBW7 antibody .",0
"This may explain why a small amount of fluorescent signal was observed on the membrane after the Raf1 and K-Ras-C 185s complexes formation .

"Conversely , we found that blocking PKC with Go6983 in HAECs had no effect on VEGF mediated Akt and eNOS phosphorylation ( data not shown ) .  In contrast , inhibition of PI3K with the specific inhibitor LY 294002 prevented VEGF induced Akt and eNOS phosphorylation as well as EC migration mediated by not only WT but also H-Ras PalM (      , A and C ) , demonstrating the importance of PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling downstream of endomembrane H-Ras .",0
"Interestingly , this effect is isoform specific , as only the p38alpha and p38beta , but not the gamma or delta isoforms , bind to Mirk .  In addition , the observation that Mirk protein levels were variable while p38 levels stayed constant suggested that endogenous p38 could only block Mirk function when Mirk levels were low ( S phase ) and not when Mirk levels were elevated ( G 0 / G 1 ) .",0
"EspG inhibits Arf GTPase activity by blocking GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) binding and thus GTP hydrolysis , while at the same time acting as an allosteric activator of PAK .  Both Arf and PAK interact with EspG simultaneously by binding to different surfaces of the effector protein .",2

"Phosphorylation of both FAK and p130Cas was significantly decreased by the inhibition of actin polymerization in nontransformed cells .  Importantly , the amount of F-actin in p53 -/ -  MEFs was not affected by transformation  and therefore oncogenic Ras mediated down regulation of FAK phosphorylation is not caused by the inhibition of actin polymerization .",0

"As mentioned above , the TSC2 and TSC1 complex suppresses mTORC1 by inactivating mTORC1 interacting protein , Rheb .

We next determined whether the BBR induced inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and COX-2 expression is mediated by inhibition of the binding of NF-kappaB to COX-2 promoter in A549 cells .

"Insulin receptor isoforms ( IR-A or IR-B ) binds insulin with high affinity , while IGF-I receptor ( IGF-IR ) binds IGF-I and IGF-II ( left ) .  In cells expressing both IR and IGF-IR , IR hemireceptors may heterodimerize with IGF-IR hemireceptors , leading to the formation of hybrid IR and IGF-IRs ( HRs ) , which bind IGF-I and IGF-II with high affinity and insulin with a much lower affinity ( right ) .",0

"Briefly , activated EGFR receptor binds the docking protein Grb2 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS , which in turn activates Ras ( H-Ras , K-Ras , N-Ras ) by exchanging GDP for GTP .

"Since IKKalpha also showed nuclear function in histone phosphorylation in LPS treated macrophage , this raises the possibility that LPS activated IKKalpha also phosphorylates p65 at Ser536 in the nucleus to terminate the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB .  However , this hypothesis seems contradictory to the previous finding that TNF-alpha-induced NIK and IKKalpha complex phosphorylates p65 at Ser536 in the nucleus to enhance NF-kappaB activity .",0
"The exact mechanism is not known but seems to rely on FAK promoting paxillin localization to the cell membrane and the recruitment of paxillin kinase linker ( PKL ) and PAK Interacting exchange Factor ( PIX ) , a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor ( GEF ) that activates Rac , which in turn activates the JNK pathway             .  Interestingly , JNK phosphorylation of S178 in paxillin enhances the binding of FAK to paxillin  creating a positive feedback loop that could promote the accumulation of paxillin at focal adhesions .",0

"Unlike other growth factors , the requirement for H-Ras in VEGF mediated activation of the ERK MAPK cascade in ECs is still debated .

"To determine if the reduced response to regulators is due to a change in binding affinity for mUbRas , we first measured the extent to which monoubiquitination disrupts the interaction between Ras and Sos cat  .  Results from these analyses indicated that the binding affinity between mUbRas and Sos cat  is 8.3 + /- 0.9 muM , which is half the observed binding affinity between Ras and Sos cat  ( 4.2 + /- 0.4 muM ) , consistent with the small reduction in the rate of GDP dissociation observed .",0
"Overexpression of Sprouty2 ( Spry2 ) wt or Spry2 P59A P304A double mutant ( unable to bind Grb2 ) block cyP and FGF elicited ERK phosphorylation but not Ras activation , probably due to an effect on Raf signaling .  However , Spry2 Y55F mutant does not inhibit cyP and FGF induced ERK pathway activation , although treatment with PGA 1  was unable to promote tyrosine phosphorylation of Spry2 ; in sharp contrast , RTK activation ( mainly EGFR ) provokes tyrosine phosphorylation of Spry2 ( at Y55 residue ) increasing its binding affinity to the SH2 domain of c-Cbl , which leads to Spry2 ubiquitination .",0
"UHRF1 binds directly to Tip60 through its SRA ( Set and RING associated ) and RING ( really interesting new gene ) domains , and in so doing markedly inhibits Tip60 and p53 complex formation .  As a consequence , UHRF1 reduced the expression of p53 target genes , such as p21 , which depend on p53-Tip60 binding at the promoter rather than p53 K120 acetylation .",0

"Thus , these inhibitors selectively impair pathway function downstream of Ras and upstream of or at the level of Raf , consistent with disruption of the Ras and Raf interaction .  Our biochemical analyses of MCP110 mediated disruption of Ras-Raf interactions in mammalian cells showed that MCP110 dose-dependently reduced Raf-RBD pulldown of Ras , displaced a fluorescently tagged Raf-RBD probe from plasma membrane locations of active Ras to the cytosol and other compartments , and decreased active , phosphorylated ERK1 and 2 .",0
"The strong association of Raf-RBD with Ras-GTP versus Ras-GDP  supports MCP110 disruption of the Ras and Raf complex , but the selectivity of MCP110 to disrupt interactions between Ras and Raf versus other GTPase and RBD pairs has also not yet been determined .  Given that it is presently unclear whether MCP110 binds to Ras , to Raf-RBD or both , it would also be of interest to evaluate the ability of MCP110 to disrupt the interaction of the RBDs of other GTPases and their effectors .",0

"The negative regulators include GTPase activating proteins ( Ras-GAPs ) , which enhance the intrinsic Ras-GTPase activity and elicit rapid hydrolysis of bound GTP .  The positive regulators correspond to the guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( Ras-GEFs ) that stimulate release of bound GDP in exchange for GTP , so the active Ras and GTP complex accumulates in response to upstream stimuli .",0

"Both NleH1 and NleH2 are also capable of binding RPS3 independent of their kinase activity .  Binding of EHEC NleH1 to RPS3 inhibits RPS3 phosphorylation by IKKbeta , which sequesters RPS3 in the cytoplasm and prevents its nuclear translocation , thereby disrupting transcriptional up regulation of RPS3 dependent genes .",0

"The regulation of p53 acetylation by MOF and MOZ has not been as well studied as that for p300 and CBP , PCAF and Tip60 .  MOF is positively regulated toward p53 thru its interaction with MSL1v1 , which stabilizes the MOF and p53 complex and facilitates p53-K120 acetylation  .",2
"Under amino acid starvation conditions and shutdown of mTOR signaling , ULK1 can phosphorylate Beclin 1 at Ser14 , resulting in a higher PI3K and III complex activity .

"PAK phosphorylates two mediators of the MAP kinase pathway , MEK1 and Raf1 , at Ser298 and at Ser338 , respectively .  ,      -      While phosphorylation of these sites by PAK is not sufficient to activate Raf1 or MEK1 , it significantly facilitates the activation of these kinases by their upstream activators Ras and Raf1 , respectively .",0
We next determined whether the BBR induced inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and COX-2 expression is mediated by inhibition of the binding of NF-kappaB to COX-2 promoter in A549 cells .  Streptavidin-agarose pull-down assay showed that BBR at the dose of 100 microM markedly inhibited NF-kappaB p50 and p65 binding to COX-2 promoter probe as compared with the control group (          .,0
Knock-down of HSP90 or pharmacologic inhibition with 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG ) resulted in a release of Hsp90 from mutant p53 bound to MDM2 allowing ubiquitination and degradation .  Thus HSP90 inhibition theoretically might help reverse the mutant p53 gain-of-function phenotype ( GOF ) attributed to mutant p53 .,0
"We then examined whether oncogenic Ras induces the activation of HtrA2 and Omi in a p53 dependent manner .  Oncogenic Ras increased phosphorylation of HtrA2 and Omi at Ser 142 in NIH3T3 cells but not in p53 -/ -  MEFs (        , top ) .",0

"However , it is not clear whether Smad2 can also enhance the transcriptional activity of p53 .  In our study , since blockade of autocrine TGF-beta signaling with DNRII expression or RIKI treatment did not significantly change total p53 levels without or with mitomycin C treatment , the reduced p53 binding to its target gene promoters in DNRII expressing cells was likely due to the inhibition of p53 activity or the blockade of p53 binding to its cis element on its target gene promoters by chromatin remodeling .",0
"We found that BBR inhibited COX-2 expression not only at protein level but also at mRNA level , suggesting that BBR could exert antitumor effect partially through suppression of COX-2 signaling .  We also found that the inhibition of COX-2 expression by treatment of BBR is partially mediated by stimulating NF-kappaB translocation from nuclear to cytosol and by inhibiting the binding of NF-kappaB to COX-2 promoter .",0

"Previous studies on IL-7 signaling in mouse naive T cells and IL-7-dependent T-cell clones indicated that IL-7 is connected to the JAK1 and 3-STAT 5 and PI3K and AKT cell signaling pathways , and that IL-7-induced PI3K and AKT activation was implicated in cell survival mainly through the phosphorylation and inactivation of the Bcl-2 proapoptotic protein BAD and through glucose uptake , which is necessary to maintain T-cell viability .  IL-7 protected human CD4 effector and memory T cells from apoptosis induced through the absence of stimulation and cytokines , and IL-7 upregulated Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 , and induced activation of the JAK and STAT signaling pathway for cell survival and up regulation of Bcl-2 proteins .",0
"RSK2 deficient human CLS cells are abolished the histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 by EGF stimulation , and re-introduction of the wild-type RSK2 to RSK2 deficient CLS patient cells restores EGF induced histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 .  Similar result is obtained by Cho and his colleagues that RSK2 -/ -  MEFs mimics histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 induced by EGF stimulation , and p53 tumor suppressor protein is involved as an intermediary protein in RSK2 mediated histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 when the cells are stimulated with EGF or UV .",0
"The MAPK pathway can also be stimulated by phosphorylation of RAF by RAS , which in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK kinases 1 and 2 ( MEK1 and MEK2 ) , which then phosphorylate and activate ERK1 and ERK2 .

"KSR1 is able to bind all three kinases of the MAPK pathway : it associates constitutively with MEK , but interaction with C-Raf and ERK1 and 2 occurs only upon growth factor stimulation .  Thus , upon Ras activation KSR brings MEK to the plasma membrane in close proximity to the Raf kinase .",0
"Although the mechanism is not clear , p53 , possibly by repressing JAK expression or increasing tyrosine phosphatase activity , prevents STAT-3 phosphorylation and subsequently affects its DNA binding capacity   .  As a result , this may act as a pro-apoptotic signal , since STAT-3 is able to increase the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl , the same proteins that are repressed by active STAT-1             .",0
"XAF1 binds to XIAP and subsequently activates XIAP 's ubiquitin protein isopeptide ligase ( E3 ) activity to catalyze survivin ubiquitination .

"Upon growth factor and insulin stimulation , Akt and ERK phosphorylates and inactivates TSC2 , releasing the inhibition of Rheb and activation of mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) .  In contrast , phosphorylation and activation of TSC2 by AMPK and GSK3beta inhibits mTOR signaling .",0
"When stable ( most often as a result of phosphorylation via ATM kinase ) , p53 acts to up-regulate p21 , which then binds to the cyclinE and CDK2 complex          .  This binding prevents downstream phosphorylation , and entry into the S phase , halting the cell cycle   .",0
"IKK phosphorylates mutant Htt , enhancing its clearance     .

"HA induced CD44 signaling increased beta1-integrin expression and activation and induced phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal proteins cortactin and paxillin .  HA induced paxillin phosphorylation was attenuated by depletion of CD44 and cortactin using RNAi and following administration of neutralizing antibodies to beta1-integrin receptors , suggesting that it is a downstream target of CD44 promoted , integrin mediated signaling .",0

"One is NEDL2 , a NEDD4 related protein that binds and ubiquitinates p73 , surprisingly increasing its stability .  Another is the NAD ( P ) H quinone oxidoreductase 1 NQO1 , that binds to p73 and prevents its ubiquitin independent degradation by the 20S proteasome .",0
"Mitochondrial GSK-3beta phosphorylates MCL-1 and VDAC amongst other mitochondrial targets .  GSK-3beta mediated phosphorylation of MCL-1 promoted its degradation and increased apoptosis , while phosphorylation of VDAC by GSK-3beta resulted in increased mitochondrial membrane permeability , again predisposing to apoptosis .",0
"DNMT1 physically interacts with acetyltransferase Tip60 , herpesvirus associated ubiquitin specific protease ( HAUSP ) , ubiquitin like containing PHD and RING finger domains 1 ( UHRF1 ) , HDAC1 and PCNA on chromatin .  Tip60 promotes acetylation of DNMT1 , which triggers ubiquitination by the E3 ligase UHRF1 , thereby targeting DNMT1 for proteasomal degradation during late S phase .",1
Further test in vivo of p53 binding to the RASSF1A promoter using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay confirmed p53 binding to the RASSF1A .  These results indicated that the p53 protein specifically binds to the RASSF1A promoter .,0
"p53KRKKK increased phosphorylation of HtrA2 and Omi in mitochondria and decreased the invasion of Ras transformed p53 -/ -  MEFs .  Altogether , these results suggest that cytoplasmic p53 restricts Ras induced cell invasion through increasing p38 MAPK induced HtrA2 and Omi activation in mitochondria .",0
"GSK-3beta can then phosphorylate beta-catenin on S33 , S37 and T41 .  The Axin and GSK -3 / CK1 and APC complex induces the degradation of beta-catenin .",1
"Loss of GAP function , or inhibition of GTP hydrolysis , might raise the levels of GTP bound Ras proteins and culminate in Ras over activity , thereby leading to oncogenic behavior .  In the same vein , if interactions with GEFs are not properly controlled , then the levels of GTP bound Ras can also increase and lead to Ras stimulated overactivity .",0
"MKP3 directly interacts with ERK through a region of the phosphatase termed kinase interaction motif ( KIM ) .  Interestingly , this interaction is independent of the phosphorylation status of ERK and its kinase activity , as phosphorylation of the activating residues of ERK does not induce a dissociation of the ERK and MKP3 complex .",0
"Binding of Sema4D to plexin-B1 stimulates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of ErbB2 , resulting in the phosphorylation of both receptors .  ErbB2 mediated phosphorylation of plexin-B1 is important for Sema4D induced activation of RhoA through PDZ-RhoGEF .",1

"Z36 can competitively inhibit the interaction between Bcl-xL and Beclin 1 in vitro , and thus it is likely that Z36 induces autophagy by blocking the interaction between Bcl-xL and Bcl -2 and Beclin 1 .  Bcl-2 phosphorylation resulted in increased dissociation of the Bcl-2-Beclin 1 complex and increased Beclin 1 dependent autophagy .",1
"Several mitochondrial derived DAMPs can induce RAGE activation , including the combination of TFAM and CpG mtDNA ( Julian et al. ,     ) .  RAGE also binds amyloid beta , a finding that suggests a possible association between RAGE and AD ( Verdier et al. ,     ; Xie et al. ,     ) .",0

Notes : Nrf2 tightly binds to homodimeric Keap1 through interaction of the ETGE and DLG motifs within the Neh2 domain and either one of the double-glycine repeat ( DGR ) sites of Keap1 .  This configuration facilitates polyubiquitination of Nrf2 by Cullin3 and Rbx1 .,1
"We provide evidence and a model         illustrating how oncogenic , activated Ras can increase the DNA binding and transcription function of SAF-1 / MAZ transcription factor , a transcriptional regulator of VEGF .

"In mammalian cells , under nutrient rich conditions , the nutrient sensor and serine and threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) phosphorylates ULK1 and 2 , and mAtg13 , preventing the assembly of a multi protein complex , which is required for autophagosome formation .

"In contrast , Ras17N interacted most strongly with PI3KC2beta followed by RasWT .  The interaction between Ras17N and PI3KC2beta was not dependent on exchange factors since this interaction with Ras17N and 69N was only moderately reduced when compared to interaction with Ras17N .",0
"Here we show that during oncogene induced senescence or other forms of stress induced senescence ( SIS ) , Pak1 mediated phosphorylation of PGAM provokes its ubiquitination and turnover .  The ubiquitin ligase MDM2 , a transcriptional target of p53 , binds to and ubiquitinates PGAM in a phosphorylation dependent manner .",0
"Our findings showed that depletion of p27 expression by knockout and knockdown approaches efficiently enhanced S6 phosphorylation in arsenite response via overactivating Ras/Raf/MEK / ERK pathway , which consequently resulted in the stimulation of p90RSK ( 90kDa ribosomal S6 kinase ) , a direct kinase for S6 phosphorylation .  Although PI3K and AKT pathway was also involved in S6 activation , blocking AKT and p70S6K activation did not attenuate arsenite induced S6 activation in p27-/- cells , suggesting p27 specifically targeted Ras and ERK pathway rather than PI3K and AKT pathway for inhibition of S6 activation in response to arsenite exposure .",0
"However , the fact that in mice lacking both S6K1 and S6K2 , phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser235 and 236 was conserved indirectly indicated that other kinases could compensate .  Further studies have shown that this phosphorylation was mediated by p90 rsk  that was itself activated by Erk .  Although Erk driven rpS6 phosphorylation is functionally relevant in T-cell receptor signaling in CD8 +  T cells , its significance in renal disease has not yet been established .",0
"Unphosphorylated 4E-BP1 interacts with the cap binding protein eIF4E and prevents the formation of the 4F translational initiation complex ( eIF4F ) ; by competing for the binding of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G ( eIF4G ) to eIF4E .  4E-BP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 results in the release of the eIF4E , which then associates with eIF4G to stimulate translation initiation [ - ,   -   ] .",1
"HA induced CD44 signaling increased beta1-integrin expression and activation and induced phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal proteins cortactin and paxillin .

"Whereas on EGF stimulation EGFR homodimers are sorted for degradation , heterodimers fail to recruit Cbl , thereby evading degradation and are instead recycled .  For example , EGFR and ERBB2 heterodimers , that are overexpressed in many human tumors , are internalized at a slower rate , with increased recycling to the cell surface     .",0
"Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both wild type and kinase-inactive p38 bind to Mirk and prevent its association with upstream activators and transcriptional co-factors .  Interestingly , this effect is isoform specific , as only the p38alpha and p38beta , but not the gamma or delta isoforms , bind to Mirk .",0
"In this study , inhibition of ERK2 with specific drugs or siRNA decreased the interaction between PML and Pin1 , leading to upregulation of PML and PML-NBs formation .

"The PI3KC2beta and Ras complex may then translocate to distal sites such as early endosomes ( EE ) where ITSN1 then binds to PI3KC2beta leading to the release of nucleotide-free Ras and activation of the lipid kinase activity of PI3KC2beta .  In addition , once released from the ITSN1 and PI3KC2beta complex , Ras binds GTP resulting in Ras activation and recruitment of effectors , e.g. , Raf , Class I PI3Ks , etc. .",1
"Both NleH1 and NleH2 are also capable of binding RPS3 independent of their kinase activity .  Binding of EHEC NleH1 to RPS3 inhibits RPS3 phosphorylation by IKKbeta , which sequesters RPS3 in the cytoplasm and prevents its nuclear translocation , thereby disrupting transcriptional up regulation of RPS3 dependent genes .",0
We therefore hypothesize that RbAp46 forms a complex with HDAC1 and then binds with Sp1 to regulate RECK expression via the Sp1 site of the promoter .  We thus determined whether RbAp46 formed a complex with HDAC1 in 7-4 cells by treatment with IPTG to induce Ras expression .,0
"In breast cancer 4T1 cells , E-cadherin protein expression was increased by OGT shRNA , while it was decreased by treatment with the pharmacological OGA inhibitors PUGNAc and NButGT .

An ASPP2 inducible U2OS cell line that expresses wild-type p53 was first used to test whether endogenous wild-type RAS binds ASPP2 with different efficiency upon EGF stimulation .  Endogenous RAS was immunoprecipitated with or without ASPP2 induction in the presence or absence of EGF treatment .,0
"The interaction between pVHL and Rpb1 is enhanced by hyperphosphorylation of Rpb1 by UV radiation , which indicates that Rpb1 ubiquitination may have a role in transcription coupled DNA repair                                                     .

"Arf expression is repressed by a number of nuclear proteins , such as Bmi1 , Twist , Tbx2 and 3 , and Pokemon .  Dmp1 is unique in that it directly binds and activates the Arf promoter and induces cell cycle arrest in an Arf dependent fashion .",0
"Phosphorylation determines Snail1 's subcellular location , as GSK-3beta -mediated phosphorylation induces Snail1 's export to the cytoplasm through exportins such as chromosome region maintenance 1 ( CRM1 ) , .

"VEGF-A , VEGF-B binds to VEGFR-1 .  VEGF-A , VEGF-C and VEGFD binds to VEGFR-2 .",0
"ATRIP binds to RPA coated ssDNA and thereby results in the recruitment of ATR to the DNA lesion .  Although the association of the ATR and ATRIP complex with RPA coated ssDNA is required , it is insufficient to increase ATR derived kinase activity .",1
"In addition to HIPK2 and D2 , WSB1 also binds to the interleukin-21 receptor ( IL-21R ; Nara et al. ,     ) .  However , instead of promoting its degradation , WSB1 inhibits the degradation of the mature form of IL-21R ( Nara et al. ,     ) .",1
"Furthermore , the Ca 2+ -dependent activation of Raf1 was found to be abrogated by knockdown of Shoc2 , a scaffold protein that binds both Ras and Raf1 .  These observations indicated that the Shoc2 scaffold protein modulates Ras dependent Raf1 activation in a Ca 2+ - and calmodulin dependent manner .",0
"Mutated K-Ras due to permanent activation of ERK1 and 2 results in enhanced autocrine production of erbB1 ligands , such as TGFalpha and AREG , which constitutively induce YB-1 phosphorylation                .  In contrast to K-RAS mt  cells , basal phopshorylation of YB-1 in K-RAS wt  cells is sensitive to serum depletion of the culture medium                , and basal YB-1 phosphorylation in K-RAS wt  cells can be further enhanced by IR or the erbB1 ligands EGF , AREG and TGFalpha                        .",0
"The formation of the ternary complex disrupts the binding interaction between wt Ras and GDP , resulting in release of the bound GDP to produce the wt Ras Cdc25 binary complex .

"Accordingly , PP2a exerts its anti-mitogenic function through the negative regulation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E ( eIF4E ) and eIF4F assembly , which requires the MAPK Mnk1 and 2 signalling mediating eIF4E phosphorylation at S209 .  Inhibition of PP2a causes increased Mnks and eIF4E phosphorylation , resulting in the dissociation of eIF4E from 4E-BP1 and the subsequent increase in eIF4F assembly , potentiating the expression of certain oncogenic proteins such as Mcl-1 and c-Myc     .",0
"ERK and JNK have positive effects on ARE mediated activities and Nrf2 transactivation , while phosphorylation of Nrf2 by p38 increases Keap1 and Nrf2 binding and therefore inhibits Nrf2 activity .  PKC directly phosphorylates Nrf2 at serine 40 , and PI3K increases Nrf2 nuclear translocation .",0
"Therefore , we asked whether IR could induce YB-1 phosphorylation as well .  As shown in Figure   , IR induces YB-1 phosphorylation differentially .",0

"In NIH3T3 cells , calmodulin binds to KRas , thereby decreasing activities of Raf and ERK .  In agreement with this observation , inhibition of calmodulin increases KRas mediated Raf activation .",0
",   Therefore , this result supports the involvement of a thiyl radical in the O 2  *- -mediated perturbation of the binding interaction between Cdc25 and wt Ras or C118S Ras .  Given that Ras Cys 51  is the target site of the oxidant that couples with the O 2  *- -mediated perturbation of this binding interaction , the thiyl radical is likely formed on the Ras Cys 51  side chain .",0
"showed that only H-Ras and N-Ras , but not K-Ras , can be co-immunoprecipitated with CHMP6 or VPS4A .  These data suggest that efficient binding of CHMP6 and VPS4A to Ras proteins requires the latter to be ubiquitylated and GTP bound and that N- and H-Ras proteins may bind them more efficiently than K-Ras does .",0
"Among them , we found that a PLC inhibitor U73122 suppressed EGF induced ERK activation and phosphorylation to ca. 50 % of the control .  Because a PKC inhibitor Go6983 did not inhibit EGF induced ERK activation , we speculated that a PLC mediated increase in Ca 2+  influx enhanced the Ras mediated ERK activation in a PKC independent manner .",0
"To further confirm whether p300 and CBP physically associated with the affected genes , we next performed a ChIP analysis .

"This occurs , for example , when the expression level of GH receptor is increased , suggesting that optimal inhibition of JAK2 occurs when SOCS3 is bound to the GH receptor .  Similarly , SOCS3 both inhibits IL-2 signalling and associates with the activated IL-2Rbeta chain , and its ability to inhibit JAK1 activity is significantly augmented in the presence of the IL-2Rbeta chain which suggests that receptor association is necessary for maximal inhibition .",0

"KEAP1 interacts with NRF2 and forms a complex with the E3 ligase CUL3 that results in NRF2 ubiquitylation and degradation by the proteasome ( depicted as a blue X ) .  The p53 target gene , p21 , interacts with KEAP1 and inhibits NRF2 ubiquitylation and degradation .",0
"The cellularly abundant GTP displaces the wt Ras bound Cdc25 to produce the GTP bound wt Ras .

Importantly the notable point is UVB stimulation induces p53 phosphorylation at Ser15  and RSK2 phosphorylation at Thr577 .  RSK2 mediated p53 phosphorylation in cytoplasm induces nuclear p53 accumulation and increases RSK2 and histone H3 interaction .,0
RITA could not displace MDM2 binding in these experiments leading to the conclusion that RITA does not bind the N-terminus of p53 .  An alternative mechanism for RITA mediated p53 activation in multiple myeloma cells was recently described in which RITA transcriptionally induced p53 by activating JNK signaling which as its downstream effects leads to increased c-jun binding to the AP-1 binding sites in the p53 promoter .,0
"A third possibility entails that the elevated cellular 8-oxoG levels and and or DNA damage stemming from MTH1 suppression in HMLE-Ras cells     reduces the EMT phenotype .

"ACK1 interacts with ubiquitinated EGFR to facilitate EGFR degradation , via a mechanism involving phosphorylation of the Arp2 and 3 regulatory protein , cortactin , potentially providing a link between Arp2 and 3-based actin dynamics and EGFR traffic towards degradation     .  A single somatic mutation in ACK1 that abrogates ubiquitin binding can stabilize the EGFR at the plasma membrane     , thereby prolonging mitogenic signaling after EGF stimulation and making some cancers resistant to EGFR kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib .",0
"This finding suggests that elevated 8-oxoguanine levels per se need not inhibit the EMT phenotype .  Similarly , existing research on the effect of genomic instability and DNA damage signaling proteins on the EMT indicates that these potentiate acquisition of mesenchymal traits rather than inhibit them .",0
"As ubiquitination often requires prior modification of the target protein , we investigated whether PGAM might be phosphorylated during SIS , specifically by Pak1 .

"In addition , inhibition of ERK activation with U0126 reduces doxorubicin induced p53 S15 phosphorylation in H9c2 cells .  As S15 is not followed by a proline ( P ) , it is thus very unlikely that ERK1 and 2 can directly phosphorylate p53 S15 .",0
"In 2010 , Ma and coworkers published a study showing that Rheb regulates the interaction between FKBP38 ( an inhibitor of mTOR ) and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 .  While bound to GTP , Rheb binds FKBP38 and thus prevents its association with mTorc1 , enabling mTorc1 to be active .",0

"Beclin 1 binding with Bcl-2 has been suggested to interfere with the ability of Beclin 1 to form a complex with hVps34 and PI3K , thus resulting in a loss of Beclin 1 associated PI3K autophagy inducing activity .  The interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 is abolished when key residues within the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 or the BH3 binding groove of Bcl-2 are mutated .",0
"However , there is a line of evidence that HIF-1 can also impair p53 activity , through the downregulation of the tumor suppressor homeodomain interacting protein kinase-2 ( HIPK2 ) .  HIPK2 phosphorylates p53 at serine 46 in response to DNA damage and subsequently activates its apoptotic function .",1
"When beta-catenin is mutated at certain nucleotides it can act as an oncogene , as the beta-catenin proteins can not be phosphorylated by GSK-3 or CKI ( depending on the residue ) .  Other regulatory proteins are also involved in controlling the activity of the Wnt and beta-catenin complex .",0
"Under hypoxia , HIF1 induces the transcription of KLHL20 , increasing its accumulation into PML-NBs .  In this scenario , two different post-translational modifications of PML make possible its interaction with KLHL20 : first , PML isoform I ( PML-I ) is phosphorylated on serine 518 by CDK1 and CDK2 .",1
"Intriguingly , although tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 negatively regulates IRS , GAB1 and PI3K and AKT signaling , it positively influences ERK activity , which is partly explained by dephosphorylation of the specific sites involved in RasGAP binding .  Downstream targets of EGFR and IR , such as ERK , GSK3 ( glycogen synthase kinase 3 ) or mTOR ( the mammalian target of rapamycin ) , feedback and phosphorylate GAB1 and IRS on serine and threonine residues , which disable tyrosine phosphorylation at sites engaging PI3K , Grb2 , RasGAP or SHP2 .",0

"showed that only H-Ras and N-Ras , but not K-Ras , can be co-immunoprecipitated with CHMP6 or VPS4A .  These data suggest that efficient binding of CHMP6 and VPS4A to Ras proteins requires the latter to be ubiquitylated and GTP bound and that N- and H-Ras proteins may bind them more efficiently than K-Ras does .",0
"In turn , CHK2 and CHK1 phosphorylate p53 at Ser20 , thereby activating it .  ATM and ATR can also directly phosphorylate p53 at Ser15 , thereby increasing its transactivation activity .",0
"At intermediary cascade level , Akt is able to phosphorylate and inhibit the activity of ASK1 and MLK3 that belong to the MAPKKK upstream activation of JNK , and the final effect is the decrease of ASK1- and MLK3 mediated cell death .  Conversely , the inhibition of PI3K-Akt in cultured cerebellar granule cells ( CGCs ) also decreases ASK1 phosphorylation , but this event is followed by an increase of p38 activity , while JNK remains at control levels .",0
"These results suggest that oncogenic Ras induces phosphorylation of HtrA2 and Omi by increasing the translocation of p38 MAPK into mitochondria in a p53 dependent manner .  Consistent with this , p53R175H diminished Ras induced phosphorylation of HtrA2 and Omi in the mitochondrial fraction .",0
"The ASPP1 N-terminus bound RAS-GTP with a four-fold higher affinity than RAS-GDP (         , compare lanes 4 and 5 ) .  To illustrate that only the N-terminal region of ASPP1 binds RAS , various truncated ASPP1 mutants were constructed .",0
"Our results demonstrate that in vitro , nucleotide-free Ras binds PI3KC2beta and that this complex is refractory to dissociation by guanine nucleotides .  Furthermore , nucleotide-free Ras inhibits the lipid kinase activity of PI3KC2beta suggesting that nucleotide-free Ras plays a negative regulatory role in signaling .",0
"In addition , PI3K interacts with Ras and is directly activated by Ras binding to p110 [  -  ] .  PI3K activation by RTKs such as the PDGFR was also reported to be regulated by Ras .",0

"G protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) and receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) , when activated by ligand , promote guanine nucleotide exchange to form activated Ras and GTP complex .

"Moreover , IL-2 increases telomerase activity in NK lymphoma cells and is associated with a PI3K and Akt-dependent elevation of telomerase activity in HTLV-1-transformed T-cells .  ,      Our group recently demonstrated that IL-2 induces telomerase activity and TERT expression , in both primary cells and cell lines derived from chronic ATL patients , and these responses are accompanied by an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1-3 and STAT5 , as well as an association between JAK1 and 2 and STAT5 .",0
"PA is crucial for epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) - induced activation of Ras because of its recruitment of the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor SOS to the plasma membrane .  However , PA seems to also exert effects downstream of Ras where it is necessary to allow Ras binding to Raf-1 .",0
"mTOR phosphorylates and activates the translational machinery proteins : eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E- ( eIF-4E - ) binding protein ( 4E-BP1 ) and p70 S6 kinase .  Upon phosphorylation , 4E-BP1 no longer interacts with and represses eIF-4E , and p70 S6  phosphorylates and activates the 40 S ribosomal protein .",1
"Downregulation of Gal-3 in MPanc96 pancreatic cancer cells was associated with decreased phosphorylation of AKT , ERK1 and 2 and also RalA-GTP activity (         , left panel ) .  Silencing Gal-3 also reduced known Ras target genes including beta-catenin , cyclin D1 and C-MYC , In contrast , up regulation of Gal-3 in BXPC-3 cells with low basal Gal-3 expression increased phosphorylation of AKT , ERK1 and 2 , and RalA activity as well as the expression of beta-catenin , cyclinD1 and C-MYC ( right panel ) .",0
"Besides MST1 , Rassf1a interacts with modulator of apoptosis 1 ( MOAP1 ) , a proapoptotic kinase known to bind to Bax , thus modulating its activity .  This interaction is stimulated by the presence of G12V KRas , resulting in an enhancement of cell death .",0
"Furthermore , EP receptors , upon PGE2 binding , activate a cytoplasmic G protein coupled receptor , Gs , which interacts with axin .  Gs and axin complex prevents axin from interacting with APC and GSK -3 beta and thus beta-catenin is stabilized by remaining non ubiquitinated and is able to carry out its transcription activity .",0

The data confirm that insulin-EGF co-stimulation increased the PI3K and GAB1 complex concentration at 30 s and 1.5 min , whereas the post-peak levels were decreased compared with EGF only stimulation , in agreement with in silico predictions (         , right panel ) .",0
"Through ERalpha and ERbeta , estrogen differentially affects Nrf2 activation , and hence it has been shown that estrogen inhibits Nrf2 activity , resulting in augmented genotoxicity .  This inhibition can result from physical interactions between ERalpha and Nrf2 ,    from competitive binding of ERalpha and the histone deacetylase SIRT1 to the promoter of Nrf2 inducible genes like NQO1 ,   or from interference with p300 recruitment leading to histone acetylation of Nrf2 target genes .",2

"In particular , RLIP76 binding to R-Ras was direct and specific for the GTP bound form of R-Ras .",2

"This finding is consistent with earlier structure-function studies in which the RLIP76 RBD did not bind to Ras .  Indeed , the RBD is predicted to form a coiled coil , unlike the ubiquitin fold common to RBDs , suggesting that RLIP76 interacts with R-Ras through a structural mechanism that is distinct from the canonical interactions of Ras proteins with effectors .",0
"We show that RLIP76 directly binds R-Ras in a GTP dependent manner , but does not interact with the closely related Ras isotypes H-Ras or Rap1A , confirming that RLIP76 is an authentic effector with relative R-Ras specificity .  Furthermore , RLIP76 mediates the effect of R-Ras on cell spreading and migration by functioning as a key link in a cascade of small GTPases in which RLIP76 binding to R-Ras capacitates adhesion mediated activation of Arf6 GTPase .",0

"Although it possesses an RA domain , similar to the RASSF1 situation          it is a somewhat controversial issue as to whether RASSF6 directly or indirectly binds Ras proteins ; one study reported that RASSF6 interacts directly with K-Ras in a GTP dependent manner with an affinity comparable to that of other known Ras effectors       yet another study reported it does not bind K-Ras , H-Ras , N-Ras , M-Ras , or TC21 under the conditions that NORE1 binds these Ras proteins      .",0
"The RASSF1A mediated regulation of Cdc20 during mitosis also appeared to be independent of Mad2 and Emi1 ( potent negative regulators of Cdc20 during mitotic progression ) , implying that RASSF1A acts in early prometaphase ( after Emi1 destruction and before activation of the Mad2 dependent spindle checkpoint ) to prevent the degradation of mitotic cyclins and to delay mitotic progression beyond metaphase ( APC is inhibited by sequestration of Cdc20 by Emi1 during S , G 2 , and prophase , then during prometaphase , RASSF1A takes on the role of the Cdc20 regulator )          .  RASSF1A 's inhibition of APC-Cdc20 activity during mitosis was subsequently shown to be regulated by RASSF1A binding protein 1 ( RBP1 ; previously termed C19ORF5 ) , as RNAi mediated depletion of RBP1 prevented both the localization of RASSF1A to the spindle poles and it 's binding to Cdc20 , resulting in premature destruction of mitotic cyclins and acceleration of mitotic progression      .",0

"The membrane recruited and subsequently tyrosine phosphorylated GAB1 and IRS influence the Ras and ERK and PI3K and AKT pathways in multiple ways .  They bind p85 , the regulatory subunit of PI3K , and alleviate the intrinsic inhibition of PI3K , which further increases PIP 3  production , thereby generating a positive feedback and a crosstalk point between EGFR and IR .  Both GAB1 and IRS can recruit Grb2-SOS , leading to Ras activation , or can bind the GTPase activating protein RasGAP , which catalyzes Ras deactivation .",0
"Intriguingly , although tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 negatively regulates IRS , GAB1 and PI3K and AKT signaling , it positively influences ERK activity , which is partly explained by dephosphorylation of the specific sites involved in RasGAP binding .  Downstream targets of EGFR and IR , such as ERK , GSK3 ( glycogen synthase kinase 3 ) or mTOR ( the mammalian target of rapamycin ) , feedback and phosphorylate GAB1 and IRS on serine and threonine residues , which disable tyrosine phosphorylation at sites engaging PI3K , Grb2 , RasGAP or SHP2 .",0

"However , unlike the Fas-FasL system , binding of TNFalpha to TNFR1 is not sufficient to initiate apoptosis .  Binding of TNFalpha to TNFR2 induces IkappaB phosphorylation and degradation and activates Nuclear Factor kappaB ( NFkappaB ) , which in turn regulates TNFalpha induced apoptosis by inducing the expression of genes which modulate apoptotic pathways ( e.g. IAPs and FLIP ) .",0
"Ras is activated by Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor mSOS , which binds the SH3 domain of the adaptor Grb2 .  Grb2 couples the Ras and mSOS complex to the IR or IGF-IR by binding both to phosphorylated Shc and IRS proteins .",0
"After activation , Ras recruits to the membrane and activates the serine and threonine kinase Raf , which phosphorylates the dual specificity kinase MEK that in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK1 and 2 kinases .  Inactive ERK1 and 2 is mainly located in the cytoplasm where it forms a MEK and ERK heterodimer .",0

The possibility of the interaction between Aurora-A and KSR or RASSF1A requires more investigation and the involvement of other unidentified factor ( s ) in ERK1 and 2 activation induced by Aurora-A in Ras V12  transformants can not be excluded .",0
"Whereas Ras bound to Raf-RBD is detected in cytoplasmic fractions ( 18.15+ / -0.92 luminescence arbitrary units ( LAU ) vs. 7.38+ / -0.74 LAU corresponding to the blank samples ) , our data shows that Ras is not bound to Raf-RBD in nuclear extracts from human mesangial cells as LAU were similar to those of the blank samples .",0

In keeping with a pro-apoptotic role , STAT-1 also binds directly to the tumor suppressor protein , p53 , which aids p53 binding to pro-apoptotic protein promoter sites .",0
"There are two possible outcomes for a clustered integrin at the cell surface , both of which are regulated by R-Ras : either it binds to ECM , or it fails to form a functional adhesion .  In the case of integrin binding to a ligand , we envision that R-Ras-dependent protrusion facilitates the initial interaction between beta 1 -integrin and the ECM , and also strengthens the adhesion by turning on Rho and ROCK .",0
"Among them , we found that a PLC inhibitor U73122 suppressed EGF induced ERK activation and phosphorylation to ca. 50 % of the control .
